      <p>
        This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
        About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo
        encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
        clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too
        great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now
        and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,
        for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and
        change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
        contain.
